/**
@example IpIntelligence/CountryOverlap.c
Country overlap analysis using 51Degrees IP intelligence.

Where IP addresses are used to restrict content to a country, sometimes
called geo fencing, an IP address whose likely area spans an international
border cannot be placed in a single country. This example measures how
often that happens by checking every IPv4 address in the data file, and
names the countries that share each country's address space. The results
can be reproduced with any enterprise IP Intelligence data file.

## What the example produces

A single CSV file and a console summary. Each CSV row pairs the most
probable, or primary, country with a secondary country for a location
confidence and connection type:

- PrimaryCountryCode, PrimaryCountry: ISO code and name of the most
  probable country for the addresses counted by the row.
- SecondaryCountryCode, SecondaryCountry: when these equal the primary
  country the row counts the addresses that resolve entirely to the
  primary country. Otherwise they name another country in the
  population weighted country list, and the row counts the addresses
  that can resolve to both the primary and the secondary country.
  Secondary countries whose share of the weighting is at or below the
  minimum percentage (default 2%) are ignored, including when deciding
  whether an address resolves entirely to the primary country.
- LocationConfidence, ConnectionType: the values of the properties with
  these names. See the
  [property dictionary](https://51degrees.com/developers/property-dictionary?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=ip-intelligence-cxx&utm_content=examples-c-ipintelligence-countryoverlap.c&utm_term=property-dictionary)
  for their definitions.
- IpAddressCount: IPv4 addresses counted by the row.
- ProportionOfPrimaryCountryAddresses: IpAddressCount as a proportion,
  where 1 is 100%, of all the addresses whose primary country is the
  row's primary country, across every location confidence and
  connection type.

An address whose area overlaps several countries appears in one row for
each secondary country, so the proportions for a primary country do not
sum to 1.

## Which weighted country list is used

The data provides two weighted country lists for the area associated
with an address. CountryCodesGeographical weights each country by its
share of the area, and CountryCodesPopulation weights each country by
its share of the people living within the area. This example uses the
population list, because the decisions it informs, such as whether a
viewer is inside a licensed territory, are about people rather than
land. A largely empty border region contributes little to a licensing
decision even when it covers a lot of ground. The area weighted split
is reported in the console summary for comparison, and probe mode
prints both lists for a single address.

## How it works

Every IPv4 address is checked individually because location results
change within network ranges. For each address the component graph is
evaluated directly, which takes a few microseconds. The full weighted
property values are only resolved through the standard results API when
the graph result changes from one address to the next, and resolutions
are cached by graph offset so each distinct location is resolved once.
A full sweep of the 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses completes in around an
hour on a modern multi core machine.

After the sweep, randomly selected addresses are compared against the
normal single address lookup process and the outcome of each comparison
is printed, so the method can be seen to produce the same values as
individual lookups would.

## Requirements

The example requires an enterprise IP Intelligence data file that
includes the weighted country code properties. It stops with a clear
message, and a distinct exit code, when the data file does not include
them, which is the case for the Lite data file. To obtain an enterprise
data file see our
[pricing](https://51degrees.com/pricing?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=ip-intelligence-cxx&utm_content=examples-c-ipintelligence-countryoverlap.c&utm_term=enterprise-data-file).

Only IPv4 is swept. IPv6 addresses are too numerous to check one by one,
although individual IPv6 addresses can be checked with the probe option.

## Usage

```
CountryOverlap <data file> [output csv] [threads] [chunks] [min percent]
CountryOverlap <data file> --probe <ip> [ip...]
```

- data file: path to an enterprise .ipi data file.
- output csv: path for the CSV, default country-overlap.csv.
- threads: number of worker threads, default 10. Each thread holds its
  own cache of resolved locations of about 600 MB, so 10 threads need
  about 6 GB in addition to the memory used by the data file. Choose
  fewer threads on machines with less memory. When a cache cannot be
  allocated at full size a smaller one is used, which is slower but
  produces the same results.
- chunks: number of /8 chunks of the IPv4 space to process starting at
  0.0.0.0, default 256 which is the whole space. Small values are useful
  for testing.
- min percent: secondary countries whose share of the population
  weighting is this percentage or lower are ignored, default 2. The
  areas can include countries with negligible weightings where the area
  shape extends beyond the evidence, so the default focuses the output
  on meaningful overlap. Set to 0 to include every listed country.
- --probe: print the resolved values for the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
  provided so they can be compared against other 51Degrees APIs. At
  least one address is required.
